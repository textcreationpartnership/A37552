         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:51601:3"/>
                  <p>Whether it doth not greatly increaſe the generall Traffique of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, not onely as it is a very ample Trade of it ſelfe betweene <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Indies;</hi> but alſo as it is an ample Staple or Magazine of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rich Indian wares to ſend from hence into other forraigne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Trade to the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> ſome few yeares paſt, when we had warre with the Portugals, did imploy fifteene thouſand tunnes of Shipping all at once, either going or comming, or Trading there from Port to Port; but ſince (upon good experience) we find that ſo great a charge is neither <hi>neceſsarie</hi> for our defence; nor <hi>comportable</hi> by the benefit of the Traffique, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſome further Diſcoveries may be made in <hi>China,</hi> or elſe-where, as is hoped: Nevertheleſſe (according to the preſent times) there may be imployed and maintained eight thouſand tunnes of great and warlike Shipping, beſides two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands tunnes more here in the <hi>Kingdome</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally repayring for the next ſupply of thoſe Voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:51601:3"/>
               <p>THis Trade as it is thus great in it ſelfe; ſo doth it yet further enlarge our Traffique and ſtrength, by furniſhing this Kingdome with all ſorts of <hi>Indian</hi> wares, not onely for our owne uſe, but more eſpecially for the neceſſary wants of forraigne Nations, which hath greatly encreaſed the number of our Warlike Ships, to export them from hence into <hi>Turkie, Italy,</hi> the <hi>Eaſt Countries,</hi> and other places: For proofe whereof we inſtance ſome former-times, when wee have brought into <hi>England</hi> above eight thouſand bagges of Pepper from the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> in one year (and may do ſo againe if the Trade ſubſiſt) Where this Kingdome doth not conſume above one thouſand and three hundred bagges <hi>per annum</hi> at the moſt; So the reſt are tranſported into forraigne Countries; and the like may be ſaid for Callicoes, Indigo, and ſome other <hi>Indian</hi> Wares.</p>
               <p>ALl which additions of ſhipping unto our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtrength by Sea before this Trade began, doe imploy many of his Majeſties ſubjects in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Arts to build and repaire the ſaid ſhips, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the making of Ordnance, Muſkets, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Shot, Swords, Pikes, Cordage, Canvas, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary Amunitions and proviſions thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to belonging; beſides a multitude of Mariners, whereof many of them are ſhipped from hence. Land-men or ſuch as were not formerly uſed to the Seas, but are bred and made good Mariners by theſe Voyages, which otherwiſe at home (being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Arts or maintainance) are a heavy burthen to their friends and Country.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:51601:4"/>
               <p>ANd if it be objected, that this great encreaſe of ſhipping which is here declared, is not alwayes in the Kingdome upon occaſion of ſervice, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is. That neither are the ſhippes of any other Merchants heere at home, but ſome are going, ſome are comming, and ever the leaſt part are in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; yet ſtill whereſoever they are, his Majeſties ſubjects have by them their imployment and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and the Kingdome aſwell as the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company have had their ſervice: For how famous are their exploits to all Nations? How many rich Carracks have they ſuncke and ſpoyled? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aſſaults of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gallions have they withſtood and foyled? What ſlaughter of their ſouldiers, ſacke of their Townes, ſubverſion of their trades, and ſuch like honourable actions have they perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med? and all with little loſſe of ſhips or men? It would require a large diſcourſe, to declare the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: Neither doth the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company commonly want two thouſand Tuns of ſhipping or more heere in the Kingdome, which are either in building or repayring, together with all their Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and other Warlike furniture, beſides their ſtore-houſes and Dock-yards, plentifully provided with Timber, Plancke, Cordage, Powder, ſhot, and many other neceſſary Ammunitions both for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and oftentimes to help others with ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions as cannot elſewhere be found for money in this Kingdome.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:51601:4"/>
               <p>THere is yet one common Objection, but it is ſo weake that it ſcarſe deſerves an anſwer, which is, that this <hi>East-India</hi> Trade deſtroyes our ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and Marriners, when cleane contrary to this we have already ſhewed the great encreaſe of both, and if men dye in theſe long voyages, and ſhips by length of time be layd up, either here or in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> yet what's all this but natures courſe? and that which happens here at home in our neereſt Trades, although with farre leſſe noyſe and notice; How many brave Commanders have we bred from meane degree? (whereof divers are ſtill in our ſervice) ſome at this preſent are found worthy good places in his Majeſties Navie, others (being growne rich) doe either keepe at home, or follow ſhorter voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; but leaving theſe advantages wee doe anſwer all with this, that whatſoever is pretended in the decay of ſhipping or death of men, yet notwithſtanding the Kingdome, by this trade hath obtained no leſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or cleare addition both of the one and the other, which continually ſubſiſt and are in action, then is before declared.</p>

It is a true ſaying, that plenty or ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of money makes all things deare or cheape in a Common-wealth, but it is neceſſary to diſtinguiſh the ſeeming plenties of money from that which onely is ſubſtantiall and able to performe the work; For there are divers wayes and meanes to procure plenty of money into a Kingdome, (for a ſhort time) which doe not therefore inrich, but rather impoveriſh the ſame, by the ſeverall inconveniencies which ever accompany ſuch alterations.</p>
               <p>FOr firſt, if we ſhould melt downe our Plate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Coyne, which ſuits not with the Majeſty of ſo great a Kingdome, except in caſes of great extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, it would cauſe plenty of money for a time, yet ſhould we be nothing the richer, but rather this Treaſure being thus altered, is made the more apter
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51601:7"/> to be carried out of the Kingdome, if we exceed our meanes by exceſſe in forraigne wares, or maintaine a War by Sea or Land, where we doe not feed and cloath the Souldier, and ſupply the armies with our owne native proviſions; by which diſorders our Treaſure will ſoone be exhauſted, for it is not the Merchants exchange by bills that can prevent the laſt of theſe evills, as ſome have ſuppoſed. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine if we thinke to bring in ſtore of money by ſuffering forraigne Coynes to paſſe currant heere at higher rates then their intrinſicke value, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with our ſtandard; or by debaſing, or by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunſing our owne monies (as ſome men have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected) all theſe actions bring their ſeverall inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, and notable ruines, as well to the King, as to his Subjects, of which we omit to enlarge, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not much pertinent to our cauſe in hand) but rather admitting that by theſe courſes, plentie of money might be brought into the Realme, yet ſhould we be nothing the richer, neither can ſuch treaſure (ſo gotten) long remaine with us, for, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Treaſure which cannot long remaine with us.</note> it be the ſtranger or the Engliſh Merchant that brings in this money, it muſt ever be done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a valuable conſideration, either for wares carried out already, or after to be exported, which helpes us nothing except the evill occaſions of exceſſe or War aforenamed be removed, which will exhauſt our treaſure; for otherwiſe, the money that one man bringeth in for gaine, an other ſhall be forced to carry out for neceſſity, becauſe there ſhall ever be a neceſſity to ballance our account with Strangers,

               <p>BUt if it ſhould be objected that the price of our Lands are not improved onely by Treaſure gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in our forraigne Trade, but alſo by a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of people, whether they be natives or ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, <note place="margin">The great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting here, doth impoveriſh this Kingdome, and begger our poore by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving them of their Arts and manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, rayſing the price of corne, victuals Rents, and the like.</note> or both: The anſwer is, that the firſt of theſe wayes doth performe it to the (common benefit) and the latter to the inriching of the Landlords onely by a manifeſt impoveriſhing of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: For our experience in one particular doth teach us, that of late yeares we are growne ſo popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that we can ſpare no corne to tranſport into forraigne Countries, but ſell it all here to ſerve our owne wants at deare rates, which formerly when it was much cheaper imployed many ſhips and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners to export it unto ſtrangers, and thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned us ſtore of Treaſure, which great benefit to the Kingdome is now loſt. And as hereby the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of our native Commodities is much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, ſo our conſumption of forraigne Wares is aſmuch increaſed, which is a double meanes to impoveriſh this Kingdome.</p>

               <p>THe buſineſſe then is briefly thus, that as the treaſure which is brought into the Realme by the ballance of our forraigne trade, is that money which onely doth abide with us, and by which we <note place="margin">Treaſure that doth remaine with us inrich us, and doth improve our Lands.</note> are inriched, ſo by this plenty of money thus got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten (and no otherwiſe) doe our lands improve, for when the Merchant hath a good diſpatch beyond the Seas, for his Cloath, and other our native wares, he doth preſently returne to buy up the greater quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which raiſeth the price of Woolls, and other commodities, which doth improve the Land-lords rents, as the Leaſes expire dayly; and alſo by this meanes money being gained and brought more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly into this Kingdome, it doth inable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men to buy Lands which muſt make them the dearer: but if our forraigne Trade come to a ſtop or declination by neglect at home, or injuries abroad, whereby the Merchants are impoveriſhed, and ſo the Wares of the Realme leſſe iſſued, then do all the ſaid benefits ceaſe, and our Lands fall of price dayly: whereupon we conclude, that as the flouriſhing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of our generall Trade is the onely meanes to make our Lands improve, ſo the particular Trade to the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> is a principall inſtrument therein, becauſe (as we have already proved) it hath ſo much increaſed the Traffique of this Kingdome.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:51601:8"/>
               <p>THe next <hi>Quaere</hi> ſeemes to be a myſtery which many of our Adventures doe not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, for (ſay they) how can the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome gaine by this Trade, when wee who are the members thereof, have loſt ſo grievouſly? they doe not well diſcerne that their private loſſe may be far leſſe in proportion, then the publique benefit, as we ſhall inſtance ſome examples to make the buſineſſe plaine.</p>
               <p>IN the courſe of forraigne Trade, there be three <note place="margin">Three degrees of gaine in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Trade.</note> ſorts or degrees of gain, the firſt, that of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, which may be done when the Merchant (who is principall agent therein) ſhall looſe. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is the gaine of the Merchant, which he doth ſometimes juſtly and worthily effect, although the Common-wealth be a looſer. The third is the gaine of the King, whereof he is ever certaine even when the Common-wealth and the Merchant ſhall be both looſers.</p>
               <p>COncerning the firſt of theſe, we have alreadie ſufficiently ſhewed the waies and meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Common-wealth may be inriched in the courſe of Trade, by the ballance of the ſame, when exceſſes are avoyded: therefore it is needleſſe here to make any further repetition: onely wee doe in this place affirme that ſuch happineſſe may be in the Common-wealth, when the Merchant for his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51601:9"/> particular ſhall have no occaſion to rejoyce. As for example, ſuppoſe the <hi>East-India</hi> Company ſhould ſend out one hundred thouſand pounds in Wares or money into the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and receive home for the ſame, the full value of three hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, hereby it is evident that this part of the publique ſtocke is trebled, and yet we may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that which we can well prove, that our ſaid Company of Merchants ſhall be looſers by ſuch an adventure, if the returnes be made in Spice, Indico, Callicoes, Benjamin, refined Salt-Peter, Cotton-yarne, and ſuch other bulkey wares in their ſeverall proportions, according to their vent &amp; uſe in theſe parts of <hi>Europe:</hi> for the freight of ſhipping, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the Adventnre, the charges of Factors abroad, and Officers at home, the forbearance of the Stocke, his Majeſties cuſtome and impoſts, with other petty charges incident, will bee above two hundred thouſand pounds, which being added to the principall produceth loſſe, and thus we ſee that not onely the Kingdome, but alſo the KING <note place="margin">The King and Kingdome may get by Trade; even when the Merchant loſeth.</note> may get very much, even when the Merchant not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſhall looſe in his proportion, which giveth good occaſion here to conſider how much more the Realme is inriched by this Trade, when all things p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:51601:9"/>
               <p>BUt for the better explaning of that which hath beene already alledged, wee muſt underſtand that if the ſaid hundred thouſand pounds ſhould be trebled by the returne of ſo much Silkes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fine Wares out of the <hi>Indies,</hi> then the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant likewiſe ſhould receive good gaine by ſuch an adventure; and the reaſon is, becauſe this great wealth would require but five hundred tunne of ſhipping to lade and bring home the ſame, which is but a very ſmall charge in reſpect of foure thouſand tunnes of ſhipping, which would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to lade home the like value in the bulkie Commodities of Spice and the like, which are afore-written.</p>
               <p>THe ſecond ſort of gaine in the courſe of trade is, when the Merchant by his laudable endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours may both bring in and carry out Wares to his advantage, by buying them and ſelling them to good profit, which is the end of his labours: Yet nevertheleſſe, the Common-wealth ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and grow poore by a diſorder in the people, when through pride and other exceſſes they doe conſume more forraigne Ware in value, then the wealth of the Kingdome can ſatisfie and pay by the exportation of our owne Commodities, which is the very quality of an unthrift, who ſpends beyond his meanes.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:51601:10"/>
               <p>THe third ſort of gaine is the Kings, who is ever ſure to get by Trade, when both the Common-wealth and the Merchant ſhall looſe ſeverally, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-written; or joyntly, as it may and doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happen when the Merchants ſucceſſe is bad, and when our Commodities are over ballanced by forraigne Wares conſumed: but if ſuch diſorders be not prevented, his Majeſty in the end ſhall be the greateſt looſer, when his Subjects be impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THis poſition is ſo contrarie to the common opinion, that it will require ſtrong Arguments, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and prove it, before it will be accepted, eſpecially of the multitude, who bitterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime when they ſee any Monies carried out of the Realme; affirming thereupon that wee have abſolutely loſt ſo much Treaſure, being an Act againſt the long continued Lawes of this Kingdome, and that many other places, nay, <hi>Spaine</hi> it ſelfe (which is the fountaine of Money) forbids the Exportation thereof, ſome caſes onely excepted. To all which wee might anſwer, that <hi>Venice, Florence, Genoa, Savoy, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellis, Turkie,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places permits it, their people applaudes it, and find great benefit by it; but all this makes a noyſe and proves nothing: Wee muſt therefore come to thoſe reaſons which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the buſineſſe in queſtion.</p>
               <p>FIrſt, therefore wee will take that for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted which none will deny us, that we have
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51601:15"/> no other meanes to get Treaſure but by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne <note place="margin">We have no Treaſure but by Trade.</note> Trade, for Mines we have none which doe afford it, and how this Money is gotten in the mannaging of our ſaid Trade, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewed, that it is done <hi>By making our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities which are Exported, to over-ballance in Value the forraigne Wares which we conſume;</hi> ſo that it reſteth onely to ſhew how our monies may be added to our Commodities, and being joyntly exported may ſo much the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our Treaſure.</p>
               <p>ANd here we will ſuppoſe, that our yearely conſumption of forraigne wares is to the valew of twenty hundred thouſand pounds, and our exportations to exceed that two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds, which ſumme we may <note place="margin">A neere eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our yearely expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and importations, as they have bin found by good inquiry.</note> thereupon affirme is brought to us in Treaſure to ballance the accompt; but now if we adde three hundred thouſand pounds more in ready mony unto our former exportation in wares, what profit can we have (will ſome men ſay) although by this meanes we ſhould bring in ſo much ready mony more then we did before, ſeeing that we have carried out the like valew.</p>
               <p>TO this the anſwer is, that when we have prepared our exportations of wares, and ſent out aſmuch of every thing as wee can
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51601:15"/> ſpare or vent abroad; it is not therefore ſaid, that then we ſhould adde our money thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to fetch in the more money immediately, but rather firſt to inlarge our Trade therewith, by inabling us to bring in more forrain wares, which being ſent out againe into the places of their conſume, they will in due time much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our Treaſure, for although in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we doe yearely multiply our importations to the maintenance of more ſhipping and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, improvement of his Majeſties Cuſtoms &amp; other benefits, yet our conſumption of thoſe forraigne wares is no more then it was before: ſo that all the ſaid increaſe of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities brought in by the meanes of our ready mony ſent out as is afore written, doth in the end become an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation unto us of a farre greater value then our ſaid monies were, which is proved by three ſeverall examples following.</p>
               <p>FIrſt, we will ſuppoſe that one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds ſterling being ſent in our ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping into the Eaſt Countries, will buy there one hundred thouſand quarters of wheat cleare of all charges aboard the ſhips, which being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter brought into <hi>England</hi> and houſed, to export the ſame at the beſt time for vent thereof in <hi>Spaine,</hi> or <hi>Italy</hi> it cannot yeeld leſſe in thoſe parts then two hundred thouſand pounds to make the Merchant but a faver, yet by this rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning we ſee the Kingdome hath doubled that Treaſure.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:51601:16"/>
               <p>AGaine this profit will be far greater when we Trade thus with our money in remote <note place="margin">The trade to the Eaſt Indies (in its propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) is the beſt trade and meanes wee have to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our Treaſure.</note> Countries, as for example, if we ſend one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds into the <hi>East-Indies</hi> to buy Pepper there and bring it hither, and from hence ſend it for <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Turky,</hi> it muſt yeeld five hundred thouſand pounds at leaſt in thoſe places, in regard of the exceſſive charge which the Merchant disburſeth in thoſe long voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in ſhipping, wages, victuals, inſuirance, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, cuſtomes, impoſts, and the like: all which charges notwithſtanding the King and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome gets. And we may here obſerve, that as the publike profit by forraigne Trade is the onely meanes whereby we gaine our Treaſure: So this Trade to the <hi>East-Indies</hi> (in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion) doth far excell all others.</p>
               <p>THe third example is, where the voyages are ſhort and the wares rich, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will not imploy much ſhipping, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the Kingdome wilbe far leſſe; as when an other hundred thouſand pounds ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in <hi>Turky,</hi> in raw ſilkes, and brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be after tranſported from hence into <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant ſhall have good gaine although he ſell it there for one hundred and fifty thouſand pounds: and thus take the voyages all together in their <hi>Medium,</hi> the ready monies exported wil be returned unto us neer trebled. But if any man will yet object that theſe returnes come to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51601:16"/> us in wares, and not really in monies as they were iſſued out.</p>
               <p>THe anſwer is, (keeping our firſt ground) that if our conſumption of forraign wares be no more yearely then is already ſuppoſed, and that our exportations be ſo mightily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by this manner of Trading with ready money as is before declared: it is not then poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible (in the courſe of trade) but that all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ballance or difference ſhould returne either in money or in ſuch wares as we muſt export againe; which as is already plainely ſhewed, will be ſtill a greater meanes to increaſe our Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: For it is in the ſtocke of a Kingdome, as in the eſtates of private men, who having ſtore of wares, doe not therefore ſay that they will not venture out, or trade with their money, (for this were ridiculous) but doe alſo turne that into wares, whereby they multiply their money; and ſo by a continuall and orderly change of one into the other grow rich, and when they pleaſe, turne all their eſtates into Treaſure, for they that have wares cannot want money, and therefore the former objection is not conſiderable: for what begot the monies which we ſent out, but our wares?</p>
               <p>NEither is it ſaid that money is the life of Trade, as if it could not ſubſiſt or paſſe currant without the ſame; for we know that there was great Trading by way of Commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Barter, when there was little Money
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51601:17"/> ſtirring in the world. The <hi>Italians</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations have ſuch remedies againſt this want, that it can neither decay nor hinder their Trade, for they transferre Bils of Debt, and have other wayes whereby they aſſigne their Credits from one to an other daily for very great ſummes with eaſe and ſatisfaction by Writing onely, whilſt in the meane time, the Maſſe of Treaſure which gave foundation, to thoſe Credits is imployed in forraine Trade as a merchandize, which doth much increaſe <note place="margin">Money inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Trade, and Trade in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</note> their trafficke. It is not therefore the keeping of our Money in the Kingdome, which makes a quicke and ample trade, but the neceſſity and uſe of our Wares in forraigne Countries, and our want of their Commodities which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Vent and conſumption on all ſides.</p>
               <p>WEe muſt not here forget the practiſe of the great Duke of <hi>Tuscany</hi> in his Port of <hi>Leghorne,</hi> which of late yeares from a poore towne is become a faire City, and one of the moſt famous places for trade in Chriſtendom, by the reſort of many Nations, but moſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the Engliſh and Dutch with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize to a very great valew yearely, and yet it is worthy obſervation that the multitude of Ships and wares which come thither, have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no meanes to make their returnes from thence, but onely in ready money, which they may, and doe carry away freely at all times and without Cuſtome, and ſuch charges to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51601:17"/> advantage, of the ſaid Duke of <hi>Tusca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> and his Subjects, who are much inriched by the continuall great concourſe of Merchants, from all the States of the neighbour Princes, bringing them plenty of money daily to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their wants of the ſaid wares. And thus we ſee that the Current of Merchandiſe which carries away their Treaſure, becomes a flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtreame to fill them againe in a greater meaſure with money.</p>
               <p>THe example of this growing greatneſſe, hath lately moved the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickely to declare his Princely reſolution to all Nations, offering them many priviledges and immunities, that ſhall come to Trade in his free Port of <hi>Vila Franca,</hi> and eſpecially a liberty to carry away ready monies for all the Wares they bring, or other occaſions: and yet we know that neither in <hi>Tuscany</hi> or <hi>Savoy,</hi> are any Mines or monies more then they have and doe daily get by Trade; but they know like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that if we yearely bring them wares (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for a very great valew) the money will immediately follow, for, let no man doubt but that money muſt ever attend on Merchandize, for they goe together: and it is worthy the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that thoſe Princes are content to part with their treaſure only to enjoy the trade of the wares which are brought them, for which (to encourage the Merchant) they take no Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome; whereas we by ſending out our money
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51601:18"/> doe gaine the imployment of our ſhipping, the Trade of the wares, and the profit of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms which is a treble benefit.</p>
               <p>THere is yet an objection or two as weake as all the reſt: The firſt is that if we trade with our money, we ſhall iſſue out the leſſe wares, as if a man ſhould ſay, thoſe Countries which heretofore had occaſion to conſume our Cloath, Lead, Tynne, Iron, Fiſh, and the like, ſhall now make uſe of our monies in the place of thoſe neceſſaries, which to affirme were moſt abſurd, or that the Merchant had not rather carry out wares (by which there is ever ſome gaines expected) then to export mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which is ſtill but the ſame without any encreaſe.</p>
               <p>BUt on the contrary there are many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries which may yeeld us very large and profitable Trafficke for our money, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe afford us no trade at all becauſe they have no uſe of our wares, as namely the <hi>East-Indies</hi> for one, in the firſt beginning thereof al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſince by induſtry in our Commerce with thoſe Nations we have brought them into the uſe of much of our Cloath, Lead, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, which is a good addition to the former vent of our Commodities.</p>
               <p>AGaine, ſome men have alledged that thoſe Countries which permit money to be carried out, doe it, becauſe they have few or no wares to trade withall: but we have great ſtore
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51601:18"/> of Commodities, and therefore their action ought not to be our example.</p>
               <p>TO this the anſwer is briefly; That if wee have ſuch a quantity of wares, as doth fully provide us of all things needfull from beyond the Seas, why ſhould we then doubt that our monies ſent out in trade muſt not neceſſarily come back again in Treaſure, together with the great gains which it may procure in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as is before ſet down? and on the other ſide if thoſe Nations which ſend out their monies, do it becauſe they have few wares of their owne; how come they then to have ſo much treaſure as we ever ſee in thoſe places, which ſuffer it free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be exported at all times and by whom ſo ever. We anſwer even by trading with their monies: For by what other means can they get it, having no mines of Gold or Silver?</p>
               <p>THus may wee plainely ſee, that when this waighty buſineſſe is duely conſidered in its end (as all our humaine actions ought well <note place="margin">Our humane actions ought eſpecially to be conſidered in their ends.</note> to be weighed) it is found much contrary to that which moſt men eſteeme thereof, becauſe they ſearch no further then the beginning of this worke, which miſ-informes their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and leads them into errour: For if wee onely behold the actions of the Husbandman in the ſeed time, when he caſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eth away much good corne into the ground, we will rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him a mad man then a Husbandman: but when we conſider his labours in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51601:19"/> which is the end of his indeavours; We find the worth and plentifull increaſe of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
